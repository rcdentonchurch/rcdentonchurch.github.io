This brass Plaque was recently discovered as part of a house clearance by a local builder. It has been restored by a local company and is now back in its rightful place here at St Mary’s Denton. 

Research has been done by a local historian in the Diocese and he has provided us with the following information. In 1922 the Parish of St Mary, Denton recorded having lost 17 of its congregation in the Great War. The Parish war memorial which took the form of a brass votive candle stand, bore the names of 26 men.


1. Men who were parishioners of the church when they went off to war.

2. Men who had been parishioners, but had left the parish prior to the war.

3. Men whose families moved into the parish while they were away at war, or after they had died.

4. Men who had a relative living in the parish, even if they themselves were never part of it.
